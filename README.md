# GenZon

GenZon is a full stack eCommerce app that allows users to sell and buy products they like. In GenZon you can find any kind of items, either by searching the item's name in the search bar or by scrolling through the specific category page that you think your item belongs to. Currently, GenZon has 5 catergories, Electronics, Fashion, Furniture, Food and Hobby. 

## Application Architecture

Genzon is built on a React frontend with a Flask backend, using PostgreSQL as a database. 

## Frontend Overview

GenZon does the majority of its applcation logic and validations on the backend, but display/interaction logic on the frontend is managed using several technologies.

### Frontend Technologies Used

#### React 

GenZon is a React application. All display logic is handled by the React libraries.

#### Redux 

All state management in GenZon is handled with Redux, with thunks making API calls to the backend server to handle the data.

## Backend Overview

GenZon uses a Flask server with a Postgresql database.

### Backend Technologies Used

#### Flask

The ability to play with the data so easly made Flask very efficent for me to use creating GenZon. 

#### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL was the database of choice because it is simple to work with, and is easily manipulable using Sequelize.

#### WTForms

WTForms made it very easy for me to implemetn validators into my app. 

#### SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy was the ORM of choice for GenZon. It made data seeding so easy.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

I'm satisfied with the funcinality of my website. However, I'm still not satisfied with my overall design. My forms are not very good looking right now, so I would like to take my time to work on the css of the site. Also, I would like to finish the orders feature soon. 



## Getting started

1. Clone this repo

  * CREATE USER <'genzon_dev'> WITH CREATEDB PASSWORD <'password'>

4. Create a .env file in the backend directory based on the .env.example

5. Enter your username and password information into your .env file along with your desired database name, a
   secured combination of characters for your JWT_Secret, and your PORT(generally 5000)

6. Add the following proxy to your package.json file within your frontend directory, replacing or
   keeping the 5000 port to match your PORT configuration found in your .env file.
  * "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
